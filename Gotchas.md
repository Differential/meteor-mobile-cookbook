# Make sure you're using the latest version of Cordova Plugins

If you're specifying your Cordova plugins using a SHA hash like so:

```
com.phonegap.plugins.facebookconnect@https://github.com/Wizcorp/phonegap-facebook-plugin/tarball/f598d00a83a1c8153abf3e23dde07ae0d81fd7d1
```

Make sure that SHA hash at the end of the URL matches a recent commit SHA on Github.
